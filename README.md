<font size="3"> Welcome to my website! My name is Yi-Chun Chen and I am a third-year PhD student at [UCLA Anderson School of Management](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Velibor Mišić](https://vvmisic.github.io/). I joined UCLA in September 2017. Before that, I was a graduate student in [ICME at Stanford University](https://icme.stanford.edu/) from 2014 to 2017 (advised by Professor [Mykel Kochenderfer](http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/)), and an undergraduate student in physics at [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/) from 2009 to 2013.

My research interests lie at the intersection of operations research, machine learning, and management. A list of publications can be found below or on [my google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sHPwfBsAAAAJ).
